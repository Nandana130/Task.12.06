    <p>‘Yes, yes, I am truly sorry!’ cried the fox just before her head disappeared once more beneath the surface of the water.

        The camel did not have the heart to watch his friend drown in the river and so he pulled the little fox out of the water and placed her upon his back. Then the camel swam the rest of the way across the river and climbed up the bank and onto the warm grass.</p>

        <p>The fox realised that she had been very selfish and said to her friend, ‘I am so sorry for what I did and I promise that you can trust me forever and that is that.’</p>

        <p>‘And I am sorry that I had to teach you a lesson today, but many times in life it is often a case of tit for tat.’</p>

        <P>Then the two friends began to laugh and roll around in the warm grass while the sunshine dried their wet fur. The fox had learned a valuable lesson that day. She had learned that it was not good to betray a friend, and that if you do wrong by somebody then somebody might well do wrong by you. It was indeed a lesson of tit for tat.</P>
