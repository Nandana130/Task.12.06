    <p>When the camel reached the river, his bones ached and he was very upset with his friend the fox.

        ‘Why did you sing when you knew that farmer would hear you and you could see that I was still eating my dinner?’ asked the camel.
        
        ‘Because it is my custom,’ replied the fox in her matter-of-fact way. ‘Now let me climb upon your back so that we may return to our home across the river.’</p>

        <h1 id="Part6">Part6</h1>
        <p>Then the camel walked slowly down the riverbank into the water and began to swim across to the other side with the fox upon his back.

            When the camel was halfway across the river, at the point where the water was at its deepest and the current at its fastest, he stopped swimming and said to the fox, ‘When I have finished eating I am accustomed to taking a bath.’</p>

            <h1 id="Part7">Part7</h1>
            <p>‘Do not take a bath!’ pleaded the fox. ‘I cannot swim and if you take a bath I shall drown!’

                ‘I am very sorry,’ said the camel, ‘but I always take a bath after I have eaten. It is my custom.’
                
                And with that the camel lowered his back into the deep water until the fox lost her grip on his back and began to splash around helplessly against the fast current.</p>

                <p>‘Help me!’ cried the desperate fox. ‘I am drowning, I am drowning!’

                    The camel asked the fox, ‘Are you sorry that you were so selfish and caused me to be beaten by the farmer?’</p>
